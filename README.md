# Modeling Dynamic Pricing in Transportation Network Systems as Markov Decision Process

Matt Battifarano

Final project for 12-735 Urban Systems Modeling at Carnegie Mellon University.

This software models surge multipliers as the actions in a Markov Decision Process. Approximate Value Iteration is used to solve the MDP.
